      %p The Good Samaritan Foundation was founded in 2008 in order to assist those less fortunate. Located in Salt Lake City, Utah, much of time and money is focused on The Refugee and Immigrant Center at the Asian Association of Utah.  Salt Lake City has over 60,000 refugees. A resettlement agency covers their first six to nine months of living expenses, and then the Asian Association picks up after that.

      %p We have opened centers in areas where many refugees live and have provided services including:

      %ul
        %li English as a Second Language training
        %li Housing assistance
        %li Employment counseling
        %li Counseling and therapy
        %li Youth programs
        %li Interpreting services
        %li Daycare
        %li Homework help for kids
        %li Hot meals for kids

      %p Another area of focus is providing these services where refugees live â€“ in their neighborhood. A good example is the Sunnyvale Neighborhood Center located in Salt Lake City.
