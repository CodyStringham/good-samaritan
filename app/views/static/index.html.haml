      %p The Good Samaritan Foundation was founded in 2008 in order to assist those less fortunate. Located in Salt Lake City, Utah, much of time and money is focused on The Refugee and Immigrant Center at the Asian Association of Utah.  Salt Lake City has over 60,000 refugees. A resettlement agency covers their first six to nine months of living expenses, and then the Asian Association picks up after that.
